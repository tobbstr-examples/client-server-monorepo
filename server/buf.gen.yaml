  # protoc-gen-go plugin, generates go types
  - name: go
    # opt is a comma separated list of options. Whitespaces are not allowed. According to the Buf docs
    # it's also possible to specify the options as an array where each option is an element of that array.
    # That works locally, but deployments get broken because of a "publish proto schemas to the registry" GitHub
    # action. This means the only option to specify multiple options is by using a comma separated string.
